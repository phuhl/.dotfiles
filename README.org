* dotfiles

** Topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to
your forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java`
directory and put files in there. 

When you run =script/bootstrap=
- anything with an extension of =.zsh= will get automatically included
  into your shell.
- anything with an extension of =.symlink= will get symlinked without
  file extension into =$HOME=
- a file =<folder>/<name>.dotconf= will get symlinked to
  =$HOME/.config/<folder>/<name>=
- the folders =bin= and =system= will be added to the =path= variable

When you run =script/install=
- you will be asked which =install.sh= files should be executed. The
  selected ones will be executed with an argument =a= or =u=  which
  classifies if the script should be run for an Arch-Linux or
  Ubuntu/Debian environment.

** Components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- =bin/= :: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- =topic/*.zsh= :: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- =topic/path.zsh= :: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- =topic/completion.zsh= :: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- =topic/*.symlink= :: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.
- =topic/(*).(*).dotconfig= :: Any file with name \1 is symlinked to .config/\2

** Install

Run this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/phuhl/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./script/bootstrap
sudo ./script/install
sudo chsh <username> /bin/zsh
#reboot
#+END_SRC

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

** Thanks

I based my dotfiles on [[https://github.com/holman][Zach Holman]]s [[https://github.com/holman/dotfiles][dotfiles]] who forked [[http://github.com/ryanb][Ryan Bates]]'
