* dotfiles

** Method

These dotfiles are organized as [[https://www.ansible.com/][ansible]] roles. Each role is
responsible for one aspect of the setup. This could be:
- a program to install and configure (i.e. KDE)
- a system setting to change (i.e. autologin)

There are two special roles, that deserve to be pointed out:
- packages :: Installs an AUR-helper (yay) and a lot of
  packages. 
  - These packages can be defined via the file in the
    packages' roles =defaults=-folder.
  - This role can be reused in other roles to install needed
    packages. (i.e. see role KDE).
- dotfiles :: Installs all dotfiles that are not installed by a
  dedicated role. Many programs are just installed and then configured
  by a dotfile. To spare me of creating a role for each program, the
  dotfiles role installs all these dotfiles in one go. The dotfiles in
  question are installed by sym-linking them from the ansible template
  into their desired folders. All dotfiles for this are found in the
  dotfiles' roles =templates=-folder.


There's a few special folders/files in the hierarchy.

- =bin/= :: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.


When installing a program, you can symlink files into the =.config/zsh=
folder to update the path, environment variables, etc. For this,
ideally, you create a subdirectory for the application, the config is
for. The following behavior is honored by the zsh config:

- =.config/zsh/**/*.zsh= :: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- =.config/zsh/**/path.zsh= :: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- =.config/zsh/**/completion.zsh= :: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  late and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- =.config/zsh/autostart.zsh= :: This file will be loaded last (if
  present) and can be used to start software on terminal
  start. I.e. the following snippet starts KDE if the user is on TTY1
  and no display session is running:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] && [ -n "$XDG_VTNR" ] && [ "$XDG_VTNR" -eq 1 ]; then
    exec startplasma-wayland
  fi
  #+END_SRC
  Make sure to keep the if, if you don't want the auto-start-command
  to run on every zsh session ðŸ˜‰.

** What's inside

Currently, Wayland with KDE and a lot of software. I just made the
switch to Wayland and am not in the mood to build up a complete system
basically from scratch ðŸ™ˆ

** Install

These dotfiles are installed using ansible. To install them, first
install ansible (=pacman -S ansible=).


Run this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/phuhl/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
pacman -S ansible
ansible-playbook setup.yml -i inventory -K
#reboot
#+END_SRC


** Currently missing:

- Missing installs:
  - notify-send.py
- Installing root scripts (still needed?)
    
*** TODO Wayland: Non Gtk/Gnome compositors

Add a rofi role:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- name: Update Repo packages
  become: yes
  pacman:
    update_cache: yes
    upgrade: yes

- name: Remove AUR packages
  become: yes
  pacman:
    state: removed
    name:
      - rofi

- name: Install AUR packages
  become: yes
  aur:
    use: yay
    state: present
    name:
      #      - rofi-lbonn-wayland
      - rofi-lbonn-wayland-git
      # rofi-lbonn-wayland-git while the other one does not work
#+END_SRC


Create a role for the compositor in question. Let it also execute the
rofi role.
